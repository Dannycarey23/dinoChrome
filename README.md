A version of the Google Chrome 'Dino' game. Built using Phaser3.

## Installation guide

- Unzip the folder

To start the game, press the space bar to initiate the first jump. 
Obstacles can either be jumped over with space bar, or in some cases, ducked under using the keypad down button. 

The game will speed up incrementally which increases the difficulty.
